# What is IR-Flash ?
Automated Script to capture forensic evidences (logs) from an Windows EndPoint. You do not need any hitups while collecting the logs. Just need to run the IR-dump.bat script with the administrative privilege. And see the script doing all the magic.

  7. System Information
  8. Service list
  9. Process list
  10. Eventlogs- (Application, Security, PS), Defenderlogs, Firewalllogs
  11. GPO (text and HTML)
  12. Windows Scheduler
  13. Audit Policy
  14. net user
  15. net localgroups
  16. net session
  17. net share
  18. doskey /history
  19. powershell logs for all users where accessible
  20. Registry
  21. AV Vendor logs (Cylance, McAfee, Defender, TrendMicro)- If exists

# How to use this ?
  1. Open a CMD prompt with Administrive privilege on the machine from which you need to gather the logs
  2. Extract the IR-Dump.zip file
  3. CD to the location where you have saved the file
  4. Run- "IR-dump.bat" (Detailed logs too big for email but great for malware diags)
  5. Run- "IR-dump.bat /m" (As above but also captures a memory dump)
  6. Run- "IR-dump.bat /s" (Small eventvwr logs only - if you're short of space fits into email but not much details)
  7. Run- "IR-dump.bat /f" (Also captures file system permissions (slow))
  8. Run- "IR-dump.bat /h" (Capures with windows file system hashes (very slow))
  9. Run- "IR-dump.bat /f /m /h" (All options above (Very Very Slow you probably don't want this), but can be done while needed)
